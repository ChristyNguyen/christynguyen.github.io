#### Purpose:
This small-scale project is a proof of concept for a 'Smart Light' controller that features two modes: Light Sensor Mode and Bed Time Mode. Light Sensor Mode utilizes natural sunlight as one's main light source by brightening or dimming according to the current brightness of the room. Bed Time Mode encourages the user to go to sleep by dimming at set intervals until a predetermined time. The purpose in creating this Smart Light was for a group project at Seneca College.

#### Process:
My main role in this project was producing the code that ran on the Raspberry Pi. With the help of the Python documentation and tutorials regarding a similar concept, I was able to create a Python script that implemented our idea. I also assisted in establishing and rearranging the electrical connections on the breadboard.

#### Results:
As a result of this project, I learned about the RPi GPIO ports and how to use them. I also learned basic Python which I found quite easy to grasp and read. Working with electronic components (breadboards, LEDs, buttons, capacitors, photoresistors) was also an experience I enjoyed. The group dynamic was especially successful because everyone came together to create a working proof of concept.
