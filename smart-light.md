#### Purpose:
This is a proof of concept for a 'Smart Light' that would brighten or dim according to the current brightness of the surrounding environment. This small-scale project has two modes: Light Sensor Mode and Bed Time Mode. The purpose in creating this Smart Light was for a school group project.

#### Process:
My main role in this project was producing the code that ran on the Raspberry Pi. With the help of the Python documentation and articles about a similar concept, I was able to create a Python script that implemented our idea. I also assisted in establishing and rearranging the electrical connections on the breadboard.

#### Results:
As a result of this project, I learned about the RPi GPIO ports and how to use them. I also learned basic Python which I found quite easy to grasp and read. Working with electronic components (breadboards, LEDs, buttons, capacitors, photoresistors) was also very enjoyable. The group dynamic was especially successful because everyone came together to create a working proof of concept.
