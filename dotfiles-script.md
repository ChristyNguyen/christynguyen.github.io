##### February 2018

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/ChristyNguyen/dotfiles)

#### Purpose:
This is a Bash script to symlink my custom vimrc file to the home directory of the current system. I created this for the purpose of having my preferred vim configurations wherever I am. The concept of roaming profiles on Windows inspired this script.

#### Process:
I utilized my skills in Bash that I developed academically in order to complete this installation script.

#### Results:
I learned to customize my vim configurations and make them portable. This script can be modified for various uses in the future, such as installing custom aliases, a custom bashrc, or any dotfiles.


#### Usage:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChristyNguyen/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
