#### Purpose:
This site is my portfolio made using a static content generator called Jekyll, hosted via GitHub Pages. The purpose of this is to display my projects to potential employers and showcase my talents that I have developed academically and personally.

#### Process:
To set up this site, I installed Ruby and Jekyll and generated a starter project. I customized it to my liking by modifying markdown and stylesheet files, then pushed it to GitHub.

#### Results:
After completing my website, I advanced my git skills and learned basic Markdown and CSS.
